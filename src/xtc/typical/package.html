<h1>The Typical type checker generator.</h1>

<dl>
This package implements Typical, a language and compiler for specification and
generation of type checkers. Typical is a domain specific language based on ML,
and currently supports Java as a target language. The compiler's main class is
{@link xtc.typical.Typical}.

<strong>ML Ancestry</strong> <br/>
Typical is a domain specific language built on the functional core of the 
O'Caml dialect of ML. Notably; Typical has the following syntactic differences 
from O'Caml:
<ul>
  <li><code>";"</code> instead of <code>";;"</code> for terminators</li>
  <li>"," instead of ";" for list separators</li>
  <li>"mltype" instead of "type"</li>
  <li>"mlvalue" instead of "value"</li>
  <li>no global "rec" since recursion is automatically detected</li>
 </ul> 
 <br/>
<a href="#features"></a>
<strong>Features</strong> <br/>
Typical also provides the following built-in constructs, types, and features 
specifically for expressing type checker specifications. 
 <ul>
 <li><em>Type Representation</em><br/>
 Typical represents source language types using the variant type 
<code>raw_type</code>. For example, the type system for an implementation of 
the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus with Integer and String values can be 
expressed as:
<pre>
   mltype raw_type = IntegerT | StringT | FunctionT of type * type ;
</pre>
The raw_type variant is sufficient to represent the type system of some 
languages such as the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, ML and Typical 
itself. For other languages, however, we need to capture information about
attributes; for example, C's qualifiers and storage classes.
For representing attributed type systems, Typical provides the 
<code>attribute</code> and <code>eqattribute</code> constructs. For example, 
C's type system could be expressed as
<pre>
   mltype raw_type = VoidT | IntT | PointerT of type | ... ;
   mltype storage_class = Auto | Extern | Register | Static | Typedef ;
   mltype qualifier = Const | Volatile | Restrict ;
   attribute storage : storage_class ;
   attribute qualifiers : qualifier list; 
</pre>
The Typical compiler collects all attributes and combines them with the 
<code>raw_type</code> variant to create a record representation of types which
 will be used by the typechecker.
<pre>
   mltype type = { type : raw_type; storage : storage_class; qualifiers = qualifer list; ... } ;
</pre>
By default, Typical evaluates type equality as structural equality ignoring
attributes introduced with <code>attribute</code> as opposed to 
<code>eqattribute</code>. This default behavior may be overridden for variant 
types by using the <code>equality</code> construct which specifies which 
constructor arguments to compare. For example, consider the following 
definition of C’s structure type:
<pre>
   mltype raw_type = ... | StructT of int * string * member list ;
</pre>
Consistent with the C standard, it uses its integer argument as
a nonce that distinguishes between structures that have the same
name and members but are declared in different scopes. The corresponding
equality declaration (meaning two <code>StructT</code>s compare equal if they 
have equal 
first arguments) reads:
<pre>
   equality raw_type = ... | StructT (n, _, _) ;
</pre>  
 </li>
 <li><em>Name Management Features</em><br/>
 Typical supports name management by providing (1) a symbol table that is 
implicitly available to all programs, (2) the <code>scope</code> construct to 
declare which AST nodes introduce which scopes, and (3) the 
<code>namespace</code> construct to declare individual namespaces, the types 
of their values, and which AST nodes specify which names. <br/><br/>

 Typical provides the following constructs for symbol table operations: 
 <code>define</code>, <code>redefine</code>, <code>lookup</code>, and <code>lookup_locally</code>. The constructs have the structures shown:
<pre>
  define no type [error|warn "error message"] [at loc]
  redefine no type
  lookup no [error|warn "error message"] [at loc]
  lookup_locally no [error|warn "error message"] [at loc]
</pre>
 Both <code>define</code> and <code>redefine</code> take a node argument (no), a value argument (type), and optional error messages and source location nodes. 

 The snippet below illustrates
 the use of <code>define</code> and <code>lookup</code>. <br/>
<pre>
   | Abstraction (id, type, body) ->
     let param = analyze type in
     let _     = define id param in
     let res   = analyze body in
       { type = FunctionT (param, res) }
   | Identifier _ as id -> let t = lookup id in t
</pre>
 In this snippet, <code>define</code> adds the name derived from the node
 <code>id</code> to the symbol table with the value type. <code>lookup</code> 
looks up  the name derived from the node id. The symbol table operations have 
built in error management. If a name is previously defined (in the case of 
define) or not defined (in the case of lookup) the operations report default 
error messages and return an error. The source location for the error is also automatically derived from the current position in the ast. The default source location can be overridden by using the <code>at loc</code> construct where loc is the name of an ast node. The default error messages can be 
overridden by explicitly adding an error clause to the operations; for example:
<pre>
   | Abstraction (id, type, body) ->
     let param = analyze type in
     let _     = define id param error "previously defined identifier" in
     let res   = analyze body in
       { type = FunctionT (param, res) }
   | Identifier _ as id -> let t = lookup id error "identifier undefined" in t
</pre>
The <code>redefine</code> operator is used for overriding previously defined
symbol table entries without reporting errors. <code>lookup_locally</code> is
used to retrieve entries that are only visibly within the current scope.<br/>
<br/>  
The symbol table operations depend on Typical's namespace construct to 
introduce new namespaces and their types and also how to extract names from
AST nodes. The namespace construct hast the structure shown:
<pre>
  namespace "default"|identifier : value = PatternMatching [and "default"|identifier : value = PatternMatching]*
</pre>
Here, "default" and identifier identify the namespace, value indicates the type
of values stored in this namespace, and PatternMatching is a matching from AST nodes to a Name constructor. <br/><br/>

 For example the namespace declaration:
<pre>
   namespace default : type = Identifier (id) -> SimpleName(id);
</pre>
indicates that there's a single default namespace, where all values have type
<em>type</em>. Identifiers are matched to names by extracting the string
child from an Identifier node and using it to create a new SimpleName. Names
can be simple, omitting the scope, or qualified, explicitly specifying a scope
 according the built-in variant type declaration:
<pre>
   mltype name =
     | SimpleName of string
     | QualifiedName of string list ;
</pre>
 The symbol table operations also depend on the scope construct to manage
 scopes while traversing the AST. The scope construct (non-exhaustively) maps 
AST nodes to scopes; each right-hand side must evaluate to a Scope constructor
value defined by the built-in variant declarations:
<pre>
  mltype scope_kind =
    | Named of name
    | Anonymous of string
    | Temporary of string ;
  mltype scope =
    | Scope of scope_kind * node list ;
</pre>
A scope spans the specified list of nodes. It can be one of three kinds. 
First, a named scope is introduced by a function or class. Second, an anonymous
 scope is introduced by a block or compound statement. Third, a temporary 
scope, unlike a named or anonymous scope, is deleted after the AST traversal 
has left the scope’s AST nodes. It is necessary for typing C or C++ function 
declarations, which may contain parameter names different from the corresponding
 definitions. Named scopes assume the specified name, while anonymous and 
temporary scopes receive a fresh name based on the specified string. An 
implementation of the scope construct depends on the ability to accurately 
trace a Typical program’s AST traversal. To this end, we restrict AST node
 patterns: they may specify several (recursively) nested nodes but only use 
variable or alias patterns for arguments of a single node constructor. With 
this restriction in place, each right-hand side of a pattern match has a 
unique parent. As a result, we can easily model the path representing the 
AST traversal’s dynamic state through a stack:
<pre>
   traversal_path : node list
</pre>
Typical’s runtime updates the stack with the parent and any matched ancestors 
before evaluating a pattern match’s right-hand side and restores the stack 
before returning the right-hand side’s value. Whenever the runtime pushes 
nodes on the stack, it evaluates the scope construct’s pattern match against
each node being added to the stack. On a match, it updates the current scope
 as specified by the corresponding Scope constructor value. Independent of a
 match, it annotates the node with the result. It uses the annotations to 
restore previous scopes when popping nodes of the stack. It also uses the 
annotations to avoid re-evaluation of the scope construct’s pattern match 
for repeated passes over the same AST.<br/><br/>
 </li> 
 <li><em>Error Management, Detection, and Reporting.</em> <br/>
 For error management, Typical provides a system-wide no-information monad.
All types are automatically injected into this monad and implicitly represent 
the union with the <code>bottom</code> type; that type’s only value is 
<code>bottom</code>. Typical's <code>bottom</code> value can be compared with 
Java's <code>null</code> value. In fact, in the generated Java code, 
<code>bottom</code> is represented by <code>null</code>. Built-in constructs 
and primitives generally return <code>bottom</code> if any of their arguments 
are <code>bottom</code>. Furthermore, all pattern matches return 
<code>bottom</code> due to an implicit clause mapping <code>bottom</code> to 
itself; this default can be overridden by explicitly matching
<code>bottom</code>. However, type constructors such as those for tuples, 
lists, and variants treat <code>bottom</code> just like any other value. It 
allows for marking, say, a type attribute as having no information without 
forcing the entire type record to <code>bottom</code>. Finally, 
the <code>is_<code>bottom</code></code> primitive enables the detection of 
<code>bottom</code> values, since the <code>=</code> and <code>!=</code> 
operators yield <code>bottom</code> when either operand is 
<code>bottom</code>.<br/><br/> To actually detect and report error conditions,
 Typical uses <code>require</code> and <code>guard</code>.
The require construct enforces one or more boolean constraints on an 
expression. For example, consider :
<pre>
   require param = tr error "argument type mismatch" in res
</pre>  
If the constraints, here "param = tr", evaluate to true, <code>require</code> 
evaluates the expression, here "res" and returns the corresponding value. If
 the constraints evaluate to false, it reports an error, here "argument type mismatch", and returns <code>bottom</code>. Unless explicitly specified, the 
traversal_path’s top node supplies the error’s source location. However, if 
the constraints evaluate to <code>bottom</code>, reduce silently returns 
<code>bottom</code>. This feature avoids cascading errors since constraints
 that evaluate to <code>bottom</code> means that an error was previously 
generated (and reported).

 </li>
 <br/>
 <li><em>List Reduction.</em><br/>
C-like languages rely on lists of specifiers or modifiers to express
the properties of declarations, including types and their attributes. When 
processing such lists, a type checker needs to (1) map AST nodes to the 
corresponding internal representation, (2) enforce semantic constraints on the
number and combination of specifiers, and (3) provide comprehensive error 
reporting. Typical addresses these needs using the <code>reduce</code> 
construct. The reduce construct has the following structure:
<pre>
  reduce to ["singleton" | "list" | "set" | "optional" | "required"] tag with PatternMatching
</pre>

As illustrated in Figure 1 using C’s type specifiers as an example,
the reduce construct selects values from a list, while also mapping
them to different values and enforcing constraints on their number
and combination. It uses an extension of ML’s pattern syntax,
the set pattern <code>{ ... }</code>, to denote that the elements may
appear in any order in the list; alternatively, a regular list pattern
can be used to indicate that the elements must appear in the specified
order. While mapping the (non-exhaustive) pattern match over
a list, reduce ignores elements that do not match any patterns;
we assume that lists, in particular those generated by the parser,
only contain legal elements. While mapping, reduce also enforces
the reduction constraints. The singleton constraint in the example
indicates that the pattern match may be triggered at most
once, while set and list constraints allow for multiple triggers
(with duplicate triggers being ignored for set constraints). A further
optional constraint specifies that the pattern match need not
match any elements. <br/> <br/>
 
The design of the reduce construct reflects our analysis of how
to type check C specifiers or Java modifiers and supports a generalization
of the corresponding requirements. For example, a list of C
specifiers must include a single type specifier such as int, reducing
the list to a "singleton". It may optionally include one storage
class specifier such as register, reducing to an "optional
singleton". It may also include one or more qualifiers such as
const, which may be duplicated and thus reduce to an "optional
set". Furthermore, Figure 5 illustrates how reduce combines several
type specifiers into one internal value; as an added benefit, the
code directly reflects the constraints specified in the C99 standard. <br/><br/>
 
Like require and guard, reduce integrates
error checking and reporting, basing any message on a string <code>tag</code> 
that describes the kind of values being selected such as "type" or
 "access modifier". For example, if processing the C declaration <code>long int
 float foo = 5;</code>, the reduce construct shown below would generate a 
"multiple types detected" error and indicate the source location.

<strong>Usage and Example</strong> <br/>
The Typical system encompasses three different programming languages and their 
compilers. The source language, the meta-language, and the bootstrap language.
 The source language is the language whose type-checker is being implemented. 
The meta-language is the language in which the type checker specification is 
written; i.e. Typical. The Typical compiler will generate code in the bootstrap
 language, which in the current implementation is Java. <br/>

As an introduction to Typical the following example presents the implementation
 of a complete type checker using the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus as the 
source language. In this example, the calculus is treated not as a formal
 system, but as a programming language whose front end we wish to implement.
<br/> <br/>

Below we have the calculus' syntax. The corresponding grammar (found in <a href="../lang/TypedLambda.rats"> lang/TypedLambda.rats</a>) 
is written for the <a href="../parser/package.html"> Rats!</a> parser generator
 and largely follows the syntactic specification shown.

Next, we use the Typical compiler and the complete 
<a href="../lang/TypedLambda.tpcl"> TypedLambda.tpcl</a> specification below 
in <strong>Figure 3</strong> to create the type checker.

<center><strong>Figure 3. Type checker specification for the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus</strong></center><br>

The specification begins with the module declaration on line 7. <br/><br/>

Lines 9-17 declare the variant type node to represent the STLC's abstract
 syntax tree structure. The variants of the node type indicate the names and 
the type of the children of all the nodes that may appear in the STLC AST to 
be type checked. Note that this specification need not be written by hand, but 
can automatically generated from a Rats! grammar specification using 
the <code>-ast</code> option.<br/><br/>

Line 20 declares the variant type <code>raw_type</code> to represent the type
 structure of
our STLC. In this case we have three types: an integer type, a string type, and
a function type.<br/><br/>

Line 22 uses Typical's scope construct to declaratively specify scope management
for the STLC type checker. The declaration can be interpreted as follows: If an
<code>Abstraction</code> node is encountered while traversing the AST the type
 checker will
enter a new Anonymous scope with a name derived from "lambda", and the first
 and third children of the <code>Abstraction</code> node will belong to the
 new scope.<br/>
<br/>

Line 24 uses Typical's scope construct to declaratively specify the STLC's
namespace management. The declaration can be interpreted as follows: All STLC
names belong to a single default namespace and have value 'type'. Symbol table
names are obtained by extracting the string value from an 
<code>Identifier</code> node, and 
using this string to create a new SimpleName.<br/><br/>

Lines 26-55 define the type rules of our STLC as pattern matches from nodes to
type. Lines 27-34 typecheck an <code>Application</code> node by first
 typechecking each child of the application, then using the
 <code>require</code> construct to enforce that the first
child has function type, and the <code>error</code> construct to report failure.
 Finally the <code>error</code> construct is used to report an error on type/argument mismatch. Lines 
36-40 process an abstraction node by analysing the second and third children,
and adding an symbol table entry using the <code>define</code> construct. Since
the define construct has built in error management, an error will be reported
if the identifier was previously defined. Successful processing of the 
<code>Abstraction</code> node returns the appropriate FunctionType. Line 41 
types an <code>Identifier</code> via
a symbol table lookup on the node. Lines 44-54 are straightforward mapping of
the<code> IntegerConstant, StringConstant, FunctionType, IntegerType, and 
StringType</code> nodes to their corresponding types.
<br/><br/>

Finally the specification can be compiled using the command <code>java 
xtc.typical.Typical TypedLambda.tpcl</code>. This generates three files:
 <a href="../lang/TypedLambdaTypes.java"> TypedLambdaTypes.java</a> which
 contains definitions for all the types used by the STCL type checker, 
<a href="../lang/TypedLambdaSupport.java"> TypedLambdaSupport.java </a>
 which contains general supporting infrastructure, and 
<a href="../lang/TypedLambdaAnalyzer.java"> TypedLambdaAnalyzer.java</a> which
 is the STLC typechecker itself. TypedLambdaAnalyzer can be incorporated into
 a Compiler or Driver (for example,  <a href="../lang/TypedLambda.java">
 TypedLambda.java</a>) for processing
STLC programs.
